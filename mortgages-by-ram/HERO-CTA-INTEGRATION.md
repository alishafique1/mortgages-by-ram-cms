# 🔗 Hero CTA Button Integration with Contact Form

## ✅ What Was Done

I've connected the Hero section CTA buttons to smoothly scroll to the contact form on the same page, creating a seamless user experience.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Hero Component Updates:
1. **Added scroll handler** - `handleScrollToForm()` function
2. **Smart button logic** - Primary button scrolls to form, secondary buttons navigate normally
3. **Smooth scrolling** - Beautiful scroll animation to the form

### ContactForm Component Updates:
1. **Added ID** - `id="contact-form-section"` for targeting
2. **Scroll offset** - `scroll-mt-20` class to account for fixed navigation

---

## 📋 Button Behavior

### Primary Button (First button or `/contact` links):
- **Clicks** → Smooth scrolls to contact form
- **No page navigation** → Stays on landing page
- **Perfect for conversion** → User fills out form immediately

### Secondary Buttons:
- **Clicks** → Navigate to specified page
- **Normal link behavior** → As configured in Strapi

---

## 🎨 Current Setup in Strapi

Your landing page already has these buttons configured:

**Button 1 (Primary):**
- Label: "Get Pre-Approved Now"
- Action: Scrolls to contact form ✨

**Button 2 (Secondary):**  
- Label: "Explore Our Services"
- Action: Goes to /services page

---

## 🔧 How to Customize

### In Strapi Admin:

1. Go to **Content Manager** → **Landing Page**
2. Find the **Hero Block**
3. Edit the **Links** section:
   - First link = Always scrolls to form
   - Other links = Navigate to pages

### To Add More "Scroll to Form" Buttons:

Set the link `href` to any of these:
- `/contact`
- `#contact`
- (Or just make it the first button)

---

## 💡 Benefits

✅ **Better Conversions** - User doesn't leave the page  
✅ **Smooth UX** - Beautiful scroll animation  
✅ **Less Friction** - One click from hero to form  
✅ **No Coding Required** - Managed through Strapi  
✅ **Mobile Friendly** - Works perfectly on all devices

---

## 🧪 Testing

To test the integration:

1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:5173
2. **Look for the buttons** in the hero section
3. **Click "Get Pre-Approved Now"**
4. **Watch it scroll** smoothly to the contact form
5. **Fill out the form** to test the complete flow

---

## 📐 Technical Details

### Hero Component Logic:
```typescript
const isScrollToForm = index === 0 || link.href === '/contact' || link.href === '#contact';
```

This checks if:
- Button is first (index 0) = Scroll to form
- Link goes to `/contact` = Scroll to form
- Link is anchor `#contact` = Scroll to form
- Otherwise = Navigate normally

### Scroll Implementation:
```typescript
const formSection = document.getElementById('contact-form-section');
if (formSection) {
  formSection.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' });
}
```

- Finds the form section by ID
- Scrolls smoothly with animation
- Positions at top of viewport

## 🎯 User Journey

1. **User lands on page** → Sees bold hero headline
2. **Reads value proposition** → Understands the offer
3. **Clicks CTA button** → "Get Pre-Approved Now"
4. **Smooth scroll** → Down to contact form (beautiful animation)
5. **Fills out form** → Name, email, phone, message
6. **Submits** → Gets confirmation message
7. **Conversion complete!** ✅

---

## 🔄 Alternative Implementations

If you want different behavior, here are options:

### Option 1: Always Navigate to Contact Page
Change the button href in Strapi to `/pages/contact`

### Option 2: Open Form in Modal
Would require adding a modal component (can implement if needed)

### Option 3: Multiple Forms
Add contact forms to multiple pages, buttons navigate accordingly
