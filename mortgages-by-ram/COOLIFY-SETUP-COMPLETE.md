## 🚀 Deployment Steps Overview

### Phase 1: VPS Setup (10 minutes)

```bash
# 1. SSH into your Hostinger VPS
ssh root@your-vps-ip

# 2. Install Coolify (one command!)
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash

# 3. Access Coolify UI
open http://your-vps-ip:8000

# 4. Create admin account
```

---

### Phase 2: Preparation (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Generate security keys (locally)
cd /Users/alishafique/Documents/Projects/MortgagesbyRam/mortgages-by-ram
node generate-keys.js

# 2. Copy the output (you'll need it!)

# 3. Ensure code is on GitHub
git status
git push origin main

# 4. Configure DNS
# Point your domain to VPS IP:
# - A record: @ → your-vps-ip
# - A record: www → your-vps-ip  
# - A record: api → your-vps-ip
```

---

### Phase 3: Deploy Backend (10 minutes)

**In Coolify UI:**

1. Create Project → "Mortgages by Ram"
2. Add Application → Connect GitHub
3. Configure:
   - Dockerfile: `server/Dockerfile`
   - Base Directory: `mortgages-by-ram/server`
   - Port: 1337
4. Add Environment Variables (from ENV-COOLIFY-TEMPLATE.md)
5. Add Storage Volumes:
   - `/app/.tmp` for database
   - `/app/public/uploads` for media
6. Set Domain: `api.yourdomain.com`
7. Click "Deploy" 🚀

---

### Phase 4: Deploy Frontend (8 minutes)

**In Coolify UI:**

1. Add Application (same project)
2. Configure:
   - Dockerfile: `client/Dockerfile`
   - Base Directory: `mortgages-by-ram/client`
   - Port: 3000
3. Add Environment Variables:
   - `VITE_STRAPI_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com`
4. Set Domain: `yourdomain.com`
5. Set Dependency: backend
6. Click "Deploy" 🚀

---

### Phase 5: Verify (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test backend
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/admin
# Should see Strapi admin page

# Test frontend
curl https://yourdomain.com
# Should see your website HTML

# Create admin user
# Visit: https://api.yourdomain.com/admin
# Fill in admin details

# Verify SSL
# Both URLs should have 🔒 (HTTPS)
```

**Total Time: ~40 minutes** ⏱️
