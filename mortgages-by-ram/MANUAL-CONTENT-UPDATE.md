WHY DO I WORK WITH FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS
```

**Content:**
```
I spend thousands of $$$ in educating myself on real-estate matters, so that I can make more money for my clients over the next 3 decades. However, I only work with First time home buyers and First time Investors, because I believe that they require the most amount of guidance in what is the most EXPENSIVE life decision.

I have a WIN-WIN job now! Let me be your inside guy ;-)
