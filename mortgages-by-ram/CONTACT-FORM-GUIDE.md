# 📋 Contact Form Guide

## Overview

I've created a fully functional contact form component that integrates with your Strapi CMS. This form is now a Strapi block that you can add to any page through the admin interface.

---

## ✅ What Was Created

### 1. **Strapi Component Schema**
**File:** `server/src/components/blocks/contact-form.json`

This defines the contact form block in Strapi with these fields:
- `heading` - Main form title (e.g., "Ready to Get Started?")
- `subheading` - Optional subtitle/description
- `buttonText` - CTA button text (default: "Book Now")
- `showPhone` - Toggle to show/hide phone field
- `showMessage` - Toggle to show/hide message textarea

### 2. **React Component**
**File:** `client/app/components/blocks/ContactForm.tsx`

Features:
- ✅ Beautiful card-based design
- ✅ Form validation (required fields)
- ✅ Loading state with spinner
- ✅ Success message after submission
- ✅ Trust indicators (Licensed, 24-Hour Response, No Cost)
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Configurable fields via Strapi

### 3. **Form Fields**
- **Name** (required)
- **Email** (required)
- **Phone** (optional, can be hidden)
- **Message** (optional, can be hidden)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Automatic (Using the Script)

The contact form is already included in the landing page when you run the update script:

```bash
node update-mortgage-content.js
```

The form will be placed after the "Why First-Time Buyers" section and before the Team section.

### Option 2: Manual (Strapi Admin)

1. **Restart Strapi server** to register the new component:
   ```bash
   cd server
   yarn develop
   ```

2. **Go to Strapi Admin:** http://localhost:1337/admin

3. **Open Content Manager** → **Landing Page** (or any page)

4. **Add a Block** → Select **Contact Form**

5. **Fill in the fields:**
   - **Heading:** "Ready to Get Started?"
   - **Subheading:** "Book your free consultation today..."
   - **Button Text:** "Book Your Free Consultation"
   - **Show Phone:** ✓ (checked)
   - **Show Message:** ✓ (checked)

6. **Save** and **Publish**

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Gradient background** (blue-50 to slate-50)

- **Professional color scheme** (Blue primary, slate text)

### User Experience

## 📍 Where It Appears on Landing Page

When using the automatic script, the contact form appears in this order:

1. Hero Section
2. Section Heading
3. Services Card Grid
4. Why First-Time Buyers
5. **→ Contact Form (HERE)** ✨
6. Team/Person Card
7. FAQ Section
8. Newsletter

This placement is strategic because:
- ✅ User has seen the value proposition
- ✅ User understands the services
- ✅ User knows why you're different
- ✅ Perfect time to capture the lead!

## 🔧 Customization Options

### In Strapi (No Code Required)

You can customize through the admin:

1. **Change the heading:**
   - "Book Your Free Consultation"
   - "Let's Talk About Your Goals"
   - "Start Your Journey Today"

2. **Toggle fields:**
   - Turn off phone if you only want email
   - Turn off message for quick contact capture
   - Keep both for detailed inquiries

3. **Customize button text:**
   - "Book Now"
   - "Get Started"
   - "Contact Me"
   - "Schedule Call"

### In Code (Advanced)

Edit `client/app/components/blocks/ContactForm.tsx` to:
- Change form styling (colors, spacing, etc.)
- Add more form fields
- Integrate with email service (Mailgun, SendGrid, etc.)
- Add analytics tracking
- Implement actual form submission

---

## 📧 Form Submission

### Current Behavior (Demo Mode)
The form currently:
1. Shows loading spinner for 1.5 seconds
2. Logs form data to console
3. Shows success message
4. Resets after 3 seconds

### To Make It Functional

You'll need to add backend integration. Here are your options:

#### Option 1: Strapi Form Submissions Plugin
```bash
cd server
yarn add @strapi/plugin-email
```

#### Option 2: Custom API Endpoint
Create a custom endpoint in Strapi to handle form submissions

#### Option 3: Third-Party Service
Integrate with:
- **Mailgun** - Email delivery
- **SendGrid** - Email marketing
- **HubSpot** - CRM integration
- **Zapier** - Connect to any service

#### Example Integration Code:
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setIsSubmitting(true);

  try {
    // Send to your backend
    const response = await fetch('/api/contact', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      setIsSuccess(true);
      // Send to Google Analytics
      if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
        window.gtag('event', 'form_submit', {
          form_name: 'contact_form'
        });
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Form submission error:', error);
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }
};
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Placement Strategy
- **After value proposition** - User knows what you offer
- **Before footer** - Natural end-of-page action
- **Multiple times** - Different pages, different contexts

### Headline Ideas
- "Ready to Get Started?"
- "Book Your Free Consultation"
- "Let's Find Your Perfect Mortgage"
- "Start Your Home Buying Journey"
- "Get Pre-Approved in 24 Hours"

### Copy Tips
- **Keep it short** - 1-2 sentence subheading max
- **Focus on benefit** - "Free", "No obligation", "24-hour response"
- **Remove friction** - Emphasize it's free and no commitment
- **Build trust** - Show license info, credentials
